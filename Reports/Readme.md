# Reinforcement Learning in Billiards and Half-field Offense Football

## Project Description

This repository contains the implementations and analyses from course assignments at IIT Bombay for the course CS&47.

### 1. Billiards with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

- **Objective:** To develop an agent that employs decision-time planning using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to pot all balls in a game of billiards with minimal attempts, despite the presence of noisy angle and force inputs.
- **Key Techniques:** MCTS was used to explore the decision space, optimizing the potting strategy by handling uncertainty in the inputs.

### 2. Half-field Offense Football using MDP-based Planning

- **Objective:** To design optimal strategies for half-field football offense using Markov Decision Process (MDP) techniques.
- **Key Techniques:** Implemented and compared the performance of Value Iteration, Howard Policy Iteration, and Linear Programming in developing strategies.

## Online Learning Techniques for Cumulative Regret Minimization in Multi-Armed Bandits

### Project Description

This project focused on implementing and analyzing various online learning algorithms for minimizing cumulative regret in multi-armed bandit problems.

- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
  - KL-UCB
  - Thompson Sampling

- **Analysis:** The performance of these algorithms was evaluated as a function of arm reward means in Bernoulli bandits.

- **Innovation:** A variation of the KL-UCB algorithm was devised for application in partially observable and noisy settings.
