## CS 747: Programming Assignment 1
### Assignment Details 

This assignment tests your understanding of the regret minimisation algorithms discussed in class, and ability to extend them to different scenarios. There are 4 tasks, which add up to 15 marks. To begin, in Task 1, you will implement UCB, KL-UCB, and Thompson Sampling, more or less identical to the versions discussed in class. Task 2A involves studying the effect of the difference between the means of two arms on the regret accumulated by the UCB algorithm. Task 2B involves studying and comparing the effect of the value of the means on the regret accumulated by UCB and KL-UCB while keeping the difference between the means constant. Task 3 involves maximising the reward for a bandit setting where pulls are noisy and give faulty outputs with a certain probability. Task 4 involves dealing with multiple bandit instances where the bandit instance for a particular pull is chosen at random. Your task would be to maximise the reward for this multiple-bandit setting.
