## CS 747: Programming Assignment 2

### Assignment Details 

In this assignment, you will write code to compute an optimal policy for a given MDP using the algorithms that were discussed in class: Value Iteration, Howard's Policy Iteration, and Linear Programming. The first part of the assignment is to implement these algorithms. Input to these algorithms will be an MDP and the expected output is the optimal value function, along with an optimal policy. You also have to add an optional command line argument for the policy, which evaluates the value function for a given policy instead of finding the optimal policy, and returns the action and value function for each state in the same format.

MDP solvers have a variety of applications. As the second part of this assignment, you will use your solver to find an optimal policy for a team of 2 football players attempting to score a goal against a single opponent in a game of football.
